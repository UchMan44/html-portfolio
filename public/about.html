<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>New to coding, but enthusiastic about my future in it. What I love most is the idea that I am given a formular 
  and told to make a website out of it! I can't wait to master this!</p>

<p>I love working out, travelling & cooking. I love christian afrobeat music but also a fan of the old school such as 
  Kool & the gang, Earth, wind & fire and a bit of Bony M.</p>

<p>I intend to build a legacy from this so looking to work hard on any project to not only create some brilliant 
  content, but I am also looking forward to learning new things!</p>
